#+title: Doc notes

* Context [1]
+ inside my comfort place and my confinement, i am able to access the whole world from my web terminal
+ following the wake of my interest in visual arts, i was presented to a group of people that introduced me to nfts
+ we would have daily gatherings in discord, where each would come and go along the day, a sort of meeting point in virtual space
  - this was by all means like a real-world comunal space, where we all could meet and share and smoke a joint together, except *we didn't ever have to step outside our rooms*
  - *confinement became social*. i found a group that shared my values, taste and references and introduced me to more references that would accelerate the growth in my art
+ i was the latest addition to the group and was well recieved by everyone
  - *i found support in a group of voices that sometimes would have a video form, in a small window inside discord*
  - i learned how these people would relate to art and the art world, learning how things were for people that had way more experience than me
  - somehow, i never felt the difference in experience was an impediment to our bonding. these voices liked what i did and i liked what they did

+ all of this made sense to me. i was raised in the internet but i was always too shy and reserved to connect with people. and now, for the first time, i had a virtual group of real friends, not just company
  - *my passion for technology and the internet met my social needs*
  - this was a confortable social space, a thing which i had so much trouble with was now easier than ever
